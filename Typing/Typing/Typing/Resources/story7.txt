As they had decided on starting at eight o'clock the next morning, every
one was in the kitchen at that hour; but the coach, its roof covered
with snow, stood by itself in the middle of the yard, without either
horses or driver. They sought the latter in the stables, coach-houses
and barns --but in vain. So the men of the party resolved to scour
the country for him, and sallied forth. They found them selves in the
square, with the church at the farther side, and to right and left
low-roofed houses where there were some Prussian soldiers. The first
soldier they saw was peeling potatoes. The second, farther on, was
washing out a barber's shop. An other, bearded to the eyes, was fondling
a crying infant, and dandling it on his knees to quiet it; and the stout
peasant women, whose men-folk were for the most part at the war, were,
by means of signs, telling their obedient conquerors what work they were
to do: chop wood, prepare soup, grind coffee; one of them even was doing
the washing for his hostess, an infirm old grandmother.
