For several days in succession fragments of a defeated army had passed
through the town. They were mere disorganized bands, not disciplined
forces. The men wore long, dirty beards and tattered uniforms; they
advanced in listless fashion, without a flag, without a leader. All
seemed exhausted, worn out, incapable of thought or resolve, marching
onward merely by force of habit, and dropping to the ground with fatigue
the moment they halted. One saw, in particular, many enlisted men,
peaceful citizens, men who lived quietly on their income, bending
beneath the weight of their rifles; and little active volunteers, easily
frightened but full of enthusiasm, as eager to attack as they were
ready to take to flight; and amid these, a sprinkling of red-breeched
soldiers, the pitiful remnant of a division cut down in a great battle;
somber artillerymen, side by side with nondescript foot-soldiers; and,
here and there, the gleaming helmet of a heavy-footed dragoon who had
difficulty in keeping up with the quicker pace of the soldiers of
the line. Legions of irregulars with high-sounding names Avengers of
Defeat, Citizens of the Tomb, Brethren in Death--passed in their
turn, looking like banditti. Their leaders, former drapers or
grain merchants, or tallow or soap chandlers--warriors by force
of circumstances, officers by reason of their mustachios or their
money--covered with weapons, flannel and gold lace, spoke in an
impressive manner, discussed plans of campaign, and behaved as
though they alone bore the fortunes of dying France on their braggart
shoulders; though, in truth, they frequently were afraid of their
own men--scoundrels often brave beyond measure, but pillagers and
debauchees.
